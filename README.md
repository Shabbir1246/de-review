# DE Review Day

These tasks are designed to help you practice your Python and SQL, it should hopefully help you solidify what you've learnt before we move onto Cloud computing next week.

## The Story

NC Department Store - We tried to setup a DB but made a right hash of it

- WE DO THIS : Your job is to create a new DB, well structured for analytical purpose (pure SQL defining table schemas and relationships)
- PART1: The pull data from the OG DB and restructure/manipulate (Python/PG8000 with testing)
- PART2: Complex queries for analysts (Mixture of complex SQL and Python PG8000 ?) - could maybe have two parts to each query, 1. do the query and 2. Do some more stuff (kata style with testing)

# Section 1: Manipulation and Insertion

# Section 2: Database Queries


PROS:

- Should hopefully cover everything they've learnt in the last 2 weeks - not sure about file and io though
- Can (hopefully) build in complexity across tasks
- Mini project

CONS:

- Has a much more strict order than FUN review, can't really do things in whatever order they fancy
- Need to make sure we balance the number of tasks well






```py

def get_items():
    return column_name, rows

def get_staff():
    return column_name, rows

def get_sales():
    return column_name, rows
